      <h1>How will you know success when it shows?</h1>
      <h5>
        If you’re ambitious, you’re bound to feel like a failure from time to
        time. Lofty goals lead to inevitable moments when you aren’t yet living
        up to your expectations. We live in a world that reinforces this
        feeling. Though most people won’t admit it—other than the guy with the
        ‘He who dies with the most toys wins’ bumper sticker—in the back of our
        minds, we equate material possessions with success. It’s a shame we fall
        prey to materialistic thinking because we certainly know better. A study
        by Strayer University found that 90% of Americans believe happiness is a
        bigger indicator of success than power, possessions, or prestige.
        Digging a little deeper, 67% defined success as “good relationships with
        friends and family,” and 60% said it is loving what you do for a living.
        Only 20% stated that monetary wealth determines success. But saying and
        doing are two very different things.

      <h3>Everything You Need To Know About Branding</h3>
      <p>
        “In good companies, the story and the strategy are the same thing.” —
        Ben Horowitz, The Hard Thing About Hard Things Our clients are small
        businesses, nonprofits and startups. We make our living by applying the
        tools and tricks that big brands and Fortune 500 companies use for
        branding and marketing to organizations that typically can’t afford
        them. The unfortunate thing is that many people who work with small
        businesses, nonprofits and startups don’t seem to understand the
        principles of branding, and the ones who do often go after the money and
        target big brands and Fortune 500 companies. For example, one of the
        most striking differences I see between the way big brands and Fortune
        500 companies do branding and the way small businesses, nonprofits and
        startups do branding is that the latter think branding is just a logo.
        Branding is about strategy. The most beautiful logo in the world
        probably will not get you any more business, but a great strategy can
        explode your revenue. Another striking difference I see between the
        marketing professionals who work with big brands and Fortune 500
        companies and the folks who typically work with small businesses,
        nonprofits and startups is the latter think branding is an art. Branding
        is a science. People — as much as I hate to admit it because I happen to
        be one — are typically not these independent thinkers that they like to
        believe they are. Collectively, they are what’s called a
        “superorganism,” much like ants and bees, and as such — like ants and
        bees — they often behave in very predictable ways. Branding is all about
        human behavior and what triggers human behavior.

      <h3>Step 1: Learn about your competitors.</h3>
      <p>
        Learn what they do well and what they do poorly. The reason you need to
        know what they do well is that you need to be at least as good as they
        are. You need to know what they do poorly because that represents
        opportunity. The term we use for this is “landscape analysis.” It is the
        understanding of the competitive landscape.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Step 2: Once you’ve learned about your competitors, articulate what it
        is that you do differently and better.
      </h3>
      <p>
        It’s that simple. If you can do this, it’s just about getting your brand
        in front of as many people as possible, and never in the history of the
        world have there been more people or more places to do this. But don’t
        confuse simple with easy. This is like the game of Go; it takes a second
        to explain and a lifetime to master. The term for this is “value
        proposition.” It is the reason people will want to work with you, buy
        your products or join your organization.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Make it believable.</h3>
      <p>
        This is where your story comes in. Tell people why you do things
        differently and better. Be careful, though — focusing on the story alone
        may be interesting and nice, but if it doesn’t support your value
        proposition, people will remember you, but they won’t buy your products
        or services or join your organization. The term most agencies use for
        this is “brand story.” I hate that term because the acronym is BS. We
        prefer “organizational story” instead because if done right, it is
        anything but BS.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4: Make your name do some of the work.</h3>
      <p>
        Naming is one of the most challenging things we do because everyone
        tries to make it personal. They want their organization’s name to be
        meaningful to them. And, sure, you can make a personal name work.
        Organizations like Walmart and McDonald’s have certainly been successful
        using personal names, but it’s much easier if you make your name
        meaningful to your customers like Apple, Nike and Tesla do.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Step 5: Run your slogan through the “different and better” filter.
      </h3>
      <p>
        A good rule of thumb is that your name makes people remember you and
        your slogan does the selling. My all-time favorite slogan is one that
        TBWA/Chiat/Day created for Apple: “Think Different.”
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6: Run your logo through it, too.</h3>
      <p>
        I’m not implying that a logo isn’t important. A great logo can be
        iconic. It is just not your brand, but an expression of your brand. It
        is your stamp of approval. And if you run the logo through the
        “different and better” filter, then something truly special happens.
        Take the Nike swoosh, for example. I love the way Nike co-founder Phil
        Knight responded when someone asked what the now-famous swoosh means:
        “It’s the sound of someone going past you.”
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7: Build a great website.</h3>
      <p>
        People often ask me why we build websites, and my answer is this: Your
        website is the most important communication tool your organization has
        because it is often the first point of contact people have directly with
        your brand. Get this wrong, and the first six steps don’t matter. One of
        the big mistakes that organizations make with their websites is they use
        the valuable real estate above the fold to tell people what they do or
        why they need them. I’ve never understood this because by the time
        people get to your website, they certainly know what you do. (Seriously,
        how else would they get there? Did they randomly click on links?) And
        they also probably have a good idea why they need you, too. An extremely
        effective approach is to treat your website like an infomercial for your
        brand. Have the menu at the top tell people what you do, so as not to
        waste space, and then use the banner and headline to communicate what
        you do differently and better. Then, like an infomercial, have the next
        section as they scroll give another reason why you are different and
        better, and so on and so on as they scroll down the page. Don’t try to
        convince people why they need your product or service; convince them why
        they need you instead. Branding is science, not art. Use the right
        triggers, and watch the magic happen.
