      <h1>Which Professional cloth is to choose?</h1>
      <h5>
        Before you decide on your outfit, find out the dress code of the company
        you are applying to. You can look at their website, social media, or ask
        someone who works there. You want to match or slightly exceed their
        level of formality, without looking overdressed or underdressed. For
        example, if the company has a casual culture, you can wear a smart
        casual outfit, such as a blouse and jeans, or a polo shirt and khakis.
        If the company has a business casual culture, you can wear a dress shirt
        and pants, or a skirt and sweater. If the company has a business formal
        culture, you can wear a suit and tie, or a dress and blazer.

      <h3>History of Clothes</h3>
      <p>
        The study of the history of clothing and textiles traces the
        development, use, and availability of clothing and textiles over human
        history. Clothing and textiles reflect the materials and technologies
        available in different civilizations at different times. The variety and
        distribution of clothing and textiles within a society reveal social
        customs and culture. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human
        characteristic and is a feature of most human societies. There has
        always been some disagreement among scientists on when humans began
        wearing clothes, but newer studies from The University of Florida
        involving the evolution of body lice suggest it started sometime around
        170,000 years ago. The results of the UF study show humans started
        wearing clothes, a technology which allowed them to successfully migrate
        out of Africa. Anthropologists believe that animal skins and vegetation
        were adapted into coverings as protection from cold, heat, and rain,
        especially as humans migrated to new climates.[1] Textile history is
        almost as old as human civilization, and as time has passed, the history
        of textiles has been more enriched. Silk weaving was introduced to India
        c. 400 AD, whereas cotton spinning dates back to 3000 BC in India.[2]
        And a recent archaeological excavation from Neolithic Mehrgarh, Pakistan
        revealed in the article Analysis of Mineralized Fibres from a Copper
        Bead, that the cotton fibers were being used as early as the 7th
        millennium BC.[3] Textiles can be felt or spun fibers made into yarn and
        subsequently netted, looped, knit or woven to make fabrics, which
        appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age.[4] From ancient
        times to the present day, methods of textile production have continually
        evolved, and the choices of textiles available have influenced how
        people carried their possessions, clothed themselves, and decorated
        their surroundings.[5] Sources available for the study of clothing and
        textiles include material remains discovered via archaeology;
        representation of textiles and their manufacture in art; and documents
        concerning the manufacture, acquisition, use, and trade of fabrics,
        tools, and finished garments. Scholarship of textile history, especially
        its earlier stages, is part of material culture studies.

      <h3>Ancient Textiles And Clothing</h3>
      <p>
        Knowledge of ancient textiles and clothing has expanded in the recent
        past due to modern technological developments.[21] It is possible that
        the next textile to be developed - after using animal skin textiles -
        may have been felt.[citation needed] The first known plant-based textile
        of South America was discovered in Guitarrero Cave in Peru. It was woven
        out of vegetable fiber and dates back to 8,000 B.C.E.[22] Surviving
        examples of Nålebinding, another textile method emerging after animal
        skin textile usage, have been found in Israel, and date from 6500
        B.C.[23] Sewing needles have been dated to at least 50,000 years ago
        (Denisova Cave, Siberia)—and are likely to have been made by H.
        Denisova/H. Altai, about 10,000 years before the arrival of Neanderthal
        and human groups in the cave. The oldest possible example is 60,000
        years ago, a needlepoint (missing stem and eye) found in Sibudu Cave,
        South Africa. Other early examples of needles dating from 41,000 to
        15,000 years ago are found in multiple locations, e.g. Slovenia, Russia,
        China, Spain, and France.[19] The earliest dyed flax fibers have been
        found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia and date back to
        36,000.[20] The 25,000-year-old Venus Figurine "Venus of Lespugue",
        found in southern France in the Pyrenees, depicts a cloth or twisted
        fiber skirt. Some other Western Europe figurines were adorned with
        basket hats or caps, belts were worn at the waist, and a strap of cloth
        wrapped around the body right above the breast. Eastern European
        figurines wore belts, hung low on the hips and sometimes string skirts.
        However, according to archeologists James M. Adovasio, Soffer and
        Hyland, the garments are more likely ritual wear, real or imagined,
        which served as a signifier of distinct social categories.
